I have always loved reading books. Today we are all overwhelmed by stimuli from screens, and I find the world of books and children's stories as a place where I can find and receive inspiration from things that happen in our lives. More than anything, my love for fables, their ability to transcend borders and times and remain relevant, led me to write the books presented to you here, adapted to our times with important messages that are still relevant today. I hope that here in the books presented to you, you too can dive in and fill your world with stories from the worlds of fables and children's stories.",
